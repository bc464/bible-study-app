He restoreth my soul: He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou hast anointed my head with oil; My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for ever."

And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years: and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth. And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so. And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good. "

And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground; but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads. The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone. And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush. And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him. And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof. And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him. And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof: and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. "

And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden. And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat."

Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them. And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever-- therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."

And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die. But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he. (Gen 7:1-24) And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female: of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground. And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him. And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground, there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah. And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort. And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life. And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in. And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth. And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died. And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark. And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days. (Gen 8:1-14) And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged; the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark. And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried. And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry."

Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark. And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done. While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. (Gen 9:1-17) And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens; with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered. Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all. But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. And surely your blood, the blood of your lives, will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud, and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."

and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before Jehovah. Lev 4:5  And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting: Lev 4:6  and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah, before the veil of the sanctuary. Lev 4:7  And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting. Lev 4:8  And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, Lev 4:9  and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away, Lev 4:10  as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt-offering. Lev 4:11  And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung, Lev 4:12  even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt. Lev 4:13  And if the whole congregation of Israel err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty; Lev 4:14  when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting. Lev 4:15  And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before Jehovah;

as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven. Lev 4:21  And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it is the sin-offering for the assembly. Lev 4:22  When a ruler sinneth, and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which Jehovah his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty; Lev 4:23  if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known to him, he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish. Lev 4:24  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is a sin-offering. Lev 4:25  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering. Lev 4:26  And all the fat thereof shall he burn upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven. Lev 4:27  And if any one of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty; Lev 4:28  if his sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to him, then he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. Lev 4:29  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering. Lev 4:30  And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar. Lev 4:31  And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor unto Jehovah; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven. Lev 4:32  And if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. Lev 4:33  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering. Lev 4:34  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar. Lev 4:35  And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven."

Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. Joh 4:7  There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. Joh 4:8  For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food. Joh 4:9  The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman?

I adjure thee by God, torment me not. Mar 5:8  For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man. Mar 5:9  And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many. Mar 5:10  And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. Mar 5:11  Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding. Mar 5:12  And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. Mar 5:13  And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, in number about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea. Mar 5:14  And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass. Mar 5:15  And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, even him that had the legion: and they were afraid. Mar 5:16  And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine. Mar 5:17  And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders. Mar 5:18  And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him. Mar 5:19  And he suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and how he had mercy on thee. Mar 5:20  And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled. "

If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. Joh 11:10  But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him. Joh 11:11  These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. Joh 11:12  The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover. Joh 11:13  Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep. Joh 11:14  Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. Joh 11:15  And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. Joh 11:16  Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. Joh 11:17  So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already. Joh 11:18  Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off; Joh 11:19  and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. Joh 11:20  Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house. Joh 11:21  Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. Joh 11:22  And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee. Joh 11:23  Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. Joh 11:24  Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Joh 11:25  Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live; Joh 11:26  and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this? Joh 11:27  She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, even he that cometh into the world. Joh 11:28  And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee. Joh 11:29  And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him. Joh 11:30  (Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.) Joh 11:31  The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there. Joh 11:32  Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. Joh 11:33  When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, Joh 11:34  and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see. Joh 11:35  Jesus wept. Joh 11:36  The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him! Joh 11:37  But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die? Joh 11:38  Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. Joh 11:39  Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been dead four days. Joh 11:40  Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God? Joh 11:41  So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me. Joh 11:42  And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me. Joh 11:43  And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. Joh 11:44  He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. "

Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. Joh 18:6  When therefore he said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. Joh 18:7  Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. Joh 18:8  Jesus answered, I told you that I am he; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: Joh 18:9  that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one. Joh 18:10  Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus. Joh 18:11  Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? Joh8:12  So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him, Joh 18:13  and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. Joh 18:14  Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. Joh 18:15  And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; Joh 18:16  but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. Joh 18:17  The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter, Art thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. Joh 18:18  Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself. Joh 18:19  The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching. Joh 18:20  Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing. Joh 18:21  Why askest thou me? ask them that have heard me, what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said. Joh 18:22  And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? Joh 18:23  Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? Joh 18:24  Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. Joh 18:25  Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore unto him, Art thou also one of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not. Joh 18:26  One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? Joh 18:27  Peter therefore denied again: and straightway the cock crew. Joh 18:28  They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover. Joh 18:29  Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man? Joh 18:30  They answered and said unto him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee. Joh 18:31  Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: Joh 18:32  that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should die. Joh 18:33  Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? Joh 18:34  Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me? Joh 18:35  Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? Joh 18:36  Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. Joh 18:37  Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. Joh 18:38  Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him. Joh 18:39  But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? Joh 18:40  They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.                                   Joh 19:1  Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. Joh 19:2  And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment; Joh 19:3  and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands. Joh 19:4  And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him. Joh 19:5  Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold, the man! Joh 19:6  When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him. Joh 19:7  The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. Joh 19:8  When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid; Joh 19:9  and he entered into the Praetorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. Joh 19:10  Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee? Joh 19:11  Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin. Joh 19:12  Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. Joh 19:13  When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. Joh 19:14  Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King! Joh 19:15  They therefore cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. Joh 19:16  Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified. "

    "text": "Joh 3:1  Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: Joh 3:2  the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him. Joh 3:3  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Joh 3:4  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Joh 3:5  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Joh 3:6  That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Joh 3:7  Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew. Joh 3:8  The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. Joh 3:9  Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? Joh 3:10  Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things? Joh 3:11  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. Joh 3:12  If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things? Joh 3:13  And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, even the Son of man, who is in heaven. Joh 3:14  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; Joh 3:15  that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life. Joh 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life. Joh 3:17  For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him. Joh 3:18  He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God. Joh 3:19  And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. Joh 3:20  For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved. Joh 3:21  But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God. "
